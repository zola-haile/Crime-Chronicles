                    <p><strong>Some insights gathered from these three are:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Population has grown from 1979-2022</li>
                        <li>California has had the largest population across the years, but other large ones are Texas, New York, and Florida.</li>
                        <li>The same states, California, Texas, New York, and Florida, have had the highest violent crime occurrences over the time span. </li>
                        <li>The crime rates (per 1000 people) reflect an interesting pattern. It appears that states with high populations in the late 1900s were also the states with the highest crime rates. But, as time progressed, and those states grew in population, their crime rate decreased. This raises a question: how are crime occurrences and population size related?</li>
                           
                    </ol>

                    <p>Figure 4 is a scatter plot of all the states' crime rates to the year for the timeline. At first glance, this graph may appear to be messy and not useful, but what stood out to us is how there is one singular line that staggers highly above all the other states. The pink line is the District of Columbia, or more commonly known as Washington D.C. (The United States’ Capital). This was very easy to miss on the choropleths, and in our data, because D.C. is not an official state, and it is miniscule.</p>
                    <embed src="div__line_viocrime_rate.html" type="text/html" height="700" width="1000">
                    <p><strong>Some insights we gathered from this graph is:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Washington D.C. has had the highest crime rate for every year on the timeline </li>
                        <li>Mere population size may not have a direct correlation on the value of crime rate. For example, if a population is large one may assume they are likely to have a higher crime rate, but the District of Columbia data proves this assumption wrong</li>
                            
                        
                    </ol>



                    <p>Figure 5 puts the total number of crimes to the population size for each state over the timeline. The size of the bubbles reflects the population size and the color is unique for each state. The purpose of this graph is to answer the question posed by the choropleths: how are crime occurrences and population size related?</p>

                        <li>We found that they are not, and if they are it is loosely. On this graph, when it is animated, one can see that as populations grow and time progresses there is little fluctuation in crime rates overall. </li>
                        <li>However, we also noticed that towards the more recent years as the population increases, crime rates have gone down. Although, we cannot conclude that that is a direct result of population increases or if it is from another external factor, such as law.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>In South Bend property crime occurs the most over the entire time span. This makes sense because the second two biggest categories are burglary and larceny, which would factor into property crime total.</li>
                        <li>The murder rate in South Bend tends to vary over the time span</li>
                        <li>Property crime also surpasses violent crime nationwide, which means South Bend reflects a normal behavior. Burglary and larceny are also significant categories in the Nationwide data set</li>
                        <li>Overall the graphs depict similar patterns amongst all crime types, one slight difference is that in South Bend aggravated assault and robbery seem to have more fluctuation. Nationwide, while both numbers are similar to one another, aggravated assault remains higher.</li>

                        These figures help put the difference in crime rates nationwide versus South Bend in an even clearer light. 
                        The first visual is an overview of crime distribution in the USA from 1992-2017. We found this by averaging 
                        the rates over the timeline and putting them into a chart that gives them a piece out of 100. The same 
                        strategy was employed for the second visualization which performs the same operation for the South Bend crime data. 
                        The bottom two visualizations place the South Bend crime rate data over the timeline directly next to, first, 
                        the national data, and then second, the state of Indiana data. Here are some insights:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Property crime takes up almost 45% of the pie chart nationwide and in South Bend </li>
                            <li>Burglary in South Bend is slightly higher than national average </li>
                            <li>Mostly the averages nationwide and in South Bend are similar, although South Bend is slightly higher in most categories </li>
                            <li>South Bend is also slightly higher in rates than most of the categories when comparing to the state of Indiana  </li>
                            <li>Only aggravated assault rate and motor vehicle theft rate are higher for the state </li>
